# intel_image_classification
 In this project i used dataset from kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification). To classify natural images i trained custom CNN models and got test accuracy 65%. This accuracy can be improve by increasing number of epochs and epochs per step. I also used pre-trained network VGG16  as a bottleneck features and got test accuracy upto 95%.
